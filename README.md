# PicPay Simplified Backend Challenge

## Technologies Used
- **Spring Boot**: Utilized for rapid development and dependency management, allowing for streamlined implementation of RESTful services.
- **Java**: Core language for the backend logic, providing robustness and flexibility.
- **RESTful API**: Implemented to facilitate communication between different components of the application.
- **Mockito and JUnit**: Employed for unit testing, ensuring code reliability and maintainability.

## Required Skills
- **Knowledge of REST**: Essential for designing and implementing a RESTful API to handle various operations.
- **Java Programming**: Proficiency in Java is necessary for developing the backend logic and implementing business rules.
- **Understanding of Dependency Injection**: Utilized Spring Boot's dependency injection mechanism for managing application components.
- **Testing Skills**: Ability to write unit tests using Mockito and JUnit to ensure the correctness of the implemented functionality.
- **Analytical Thinking**: Required to understand and address the business requirements effectively.
- **Git**: Utilized for version control, enabling collaboration and tracking of changes throughout the development process.

## Additional Notes
- Ensure adherence to best practices and conventions in Spring Boot development.
- Prioritize clean and organized code structure to enhance maintainability.
